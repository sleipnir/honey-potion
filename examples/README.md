# Examples

This directory contains several Honey examples. To build all examples automatically, follow the instructions below.

## Makefile

A Makefile is provided to automate compilation. To compile all examples:

```sh
make
```

To compile a specific example:

```sh
make <example_dir>
```

The Makefile will skip directories without a `mix.exs` file.
